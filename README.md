# HI ALAN OR JOE!

## Please start by forking, cloning, bundle installing, migrating and seeding. Much thanks.

You can head over to `/heroines` to get started. Click on a heroine to find out more details, or create your own! Keep in mind that no two heroines can have the same alias. You can choose just ONE super power, and there is an extensive list of four abilities to choose from. There's no going back (to edit) so think carefully and choose wisely.

Want to start your own super strong or super stretchy girl band of heroines? Click on an ability name to see who else shares your super duper ability!

That's pretty much the whole app. Enjoy and save the world safely.

p.s. I skipped the bonus because I spent time on making things pink. #pinktax
