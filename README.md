# HI ALAN OR JOE!

## Please start by forking, cloning, bundle installing, migrating and seeding. Much thanks.

You can head over to `/heroines` to get started. Click on a heroine to find out more details, or create your own! Keep in mind that no two heroines can have the same alias. You can choose just ONE super ability. There's no going back (to edit) so think carefully and choose wisely.

Want to start your own super strong or super stretchy girl band of heroines? Click on an ability name to see who else shares your super duper ability!

That's pretty much the whole app. Enjoy and save the world safely.

# BONUS TO BE COMPLETED IF EVERYTHING ELSE IS DONE

8. Add a filter to the index view of the heroines. This will allow the visitor to search for an existing power and display all the heroines with that power on the same view page.

### Hints / Tips
+ Draw your domain model and associations before you begin. You may have to alter the current schema to get your code working.
+ A child model cannot be persisted without being associated with its parent model.
+ More than one heroine can have the same power.
+ More than one heroine can have the same power.
+ More than one heroine can have the same power.
+ We want to be RESTful. What URL should show info about a particular heroine? What URL should show a form to create a heroine? What controller actions are associated?
+ If you're having a hard time implementing the filter, take a look at this http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#a-generic-search-form. We are asking an input field to search for powers.
